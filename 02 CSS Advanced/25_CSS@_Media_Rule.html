<!-- Definition and Usage
==========================

The '@media' rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for 
different media types/devices.

Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

  >  width and height of the viewport
  >  width and height of the device
  >  orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
  >  resolution

Using 'media queries' is a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet 
(responsive web design) to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

You can also use 'media queries' to specify that certain styles are only for 
printed documents or for screen readers (mediatype: print, screen, or speech).

In addition to media types, there are also media features. Media features 
provide more specific details to media queries, by allowing to test for a 
specific feature of the user agent or display device. 

For example, you can apply styles to only those screens that are greater, 
or smaller, than a certain width.



CSS Syntax
=============

@media not|only mediatype and (mediafeature and|or|not mediafeature) {
  CSS-Code;
}

meaning of the not, only and and keywords:
------------------------------------------

not: The 'not' keyword reverts the meaning of an entire media query.
----

only: The 'only' keyword prevents older browsers that do not support media 
----  queries with media features from applying the specified styles. 
      It has no effect on modern browsers.

and: The 'and' keyword combines a 'media feature' with a 'media type' or other 
----  media features.

They are all optional. However, if you use 'not' or 'only', you must also 
specify a media type.

You can also have different stylesheets for different media, like this:

<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 900px)" href="widescreen.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 600px)" href="smallscreen.css">
....
