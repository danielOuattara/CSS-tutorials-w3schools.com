    <h1>CSS Layout - Float More Examples.</h1><hr/>


    <h2>Example 1: An image with border and margins that floats to the right
      in a paragraph</h2>

    <p style="border: 3px solid green; padding: 10px; margin: 10px;">
       In the paragraph below, the image will float to the right.
       A dotted black border is added to the image. We have also
       added margins to the image to push the text away from the image:
       0 px margin on the top and right side, 15 px margin on the bottom,
       and 20 px margin on the left side of the image.
    </p>

    <style>
       
       #para-1 {
        text-align: justify; 
        margin-bottom:100px;
        border: 2px dotted black;
        margin: 10px;
       }
     
      .image-one {
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        float: right;
        border: 1px solid rgb(5, 9, 255);
        margin: 0 0 15px 20px;
        padding: 10px;
      }
    </style>
    <p  id="para-1">
       <img class="image-one" src="../../images/photo.jpg" alt="nice bay picture"/>

    <h2>Example 2: An image with a caption that floats to the right</h2>

    <style>
      .case-two {
        float: right; 
        /* width: 100px;  */
        margin: 0 0 15px 20px;
        padding: 10px; 
        border:1px solid green;
        overflow:hidden;
      }
    </style>

    <div class="case-two">
      <img class="image-two"src="../../images/photo.jpg"
           alt=" neutral identity picture" style= "width: 100px; height: 100px;">

        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom:100px;">
          In the paragraph above, the div element is 120 pixels
          wide and it contains the image. The div element will
          float to the right. Margins are added to the div to push
          the text away from the div. Borders and padding are added
          to the div to frame in the picture and the caption.
        </p>


        <h2>Example 3: Let the first letter of a paragraph float to the left</h2>

        <style>
          span { 
            float:left; 
            width:0.7em; 
            font-size:500%;
            font-family:courier, algerian; 
            line-height: 80%;
          }
        </style>
        <p style="border: 1px solid black; text-align: justify;">

        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom:100px;">
          In the paragraph above, the first letter of the text
          is embedded in a span element. The span element has a
          width that is 0.7 times the size of the current font.
          The font-size of the span element is 400% (quite large)
          and the line-height is 80%. The font of the letter in
          the span will be in "Algerian".
        </p>
