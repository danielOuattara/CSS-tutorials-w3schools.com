<!-- What is CSS ?
==================

    > CSS stands for 'Cascading Style Sheets'
    
    > CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, 
      paper, or in other media
    
    > CSS saves so much work time: it controls the layout of multiple web 
      pages all at once
    
    > External stylesheets are stored in .css files

Why Use CSS ?
=============

CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, 
layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

CSS Example:
-----------                                                               -->
    <style>
      body {
        background-color: rgb(113, 220, 255);
      }

      h2 {
        color: white;
        text-align: center;
      }

      p {
        font-family: verdana;
        font-size: 20px;
      }

    </style>

      <h2>My First CSS Example</h2>
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>


<!--CSS Solved a Big Problem
============================

HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page 
but was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

<h1>This is a heading</h1>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2
specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. 
Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were 
added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!


CSS Saves a Lot of Work !
=========================

The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.
With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire
website by changing just one file!                                        -->
