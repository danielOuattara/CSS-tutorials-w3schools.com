<!-- What is Specificity ?
==========================

If there are two or more conflicting CSS rules (or selectors) that point to the same 
element, the browser follows some rules to determine which one is most 
specific and therefore wins out.

Think of 'specificity' as a score/rank that determines which style 
declarations are ultimately applied to an element.

The 'universal selector (*)' has low specificity, while 'ID selectors' are 
highly specific ! 


Note: 'Specificity' is a common reason why your CSS-rules don't apply 
=====  to some elements, although you think they should.


Specificity Hierarchy
======================

Every selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy. 
There are four categories which define the specificity level of a selector:

> Inline styles : 
-----------------
An inline style is attached directly to the element to be styled. 
Example: <h1 style="color: #ffffff;">.


> IDs : 
-------
An ID is a unique identifier for elements.
Example:  '#navbar'.


> Classes, attributes, pseudo-classes:
-----------------------------------------
This category includes .classes, [attributes] and pseudo-classes 
Example: .text , [alt], [submit],  :hover, :focus etc.


> Elements, pseudo-elements:
--------------------------------
This category includes elements and pseudo-elements:
 Example:  h1, div, :before, :after.


How to Calculate Specificity ?
==============================

    > Start at 0,
    > add 1000 for style attribute, 
    > add 100 for each ID, 
    > add 10 for each attribute, class, pseudo-class, 
    > add 1 for each element, pseudo-element.

Consider these three code fragments: 

A: h1
B: #content h1
C: <div id="content"><h1 style="color: #ffffff">Heading</h1></div>
_________________________________________

The specificity of A is 1 (one element)
The specificity of B is 101 (one ID reference + one element)
The specificity of C is 1000 (inline styling)

Since 1 < 101 < 1000, the third rule (C) has a greater level of specificity, 
and therefore will be applied.


Specificity Rules
==================

Equal specificity the latest rule counts: 
-----------------------------------------

If the same rule is written twice into the external style sheet, 
then the lower rule in the style sheet is closer to the element 
to be styled, and therefore will be applied:


h1 {background-color: yellow;}
h1 {background-color: red;}     /*this rule is applied*/
__________________________________________________________


ID selectors have a higher specificity than attribute selectors:
----------------------------------------------------------------

Look at the following three code lines:

div#a {background-color: green;}  /* 1 + 100  */
#a {background-color: yellow;}    /* 100  */
div[id=a] {background-color: blue;} /* 1 + 10 * /
____________________________________

the first rule is more specific than the other two, and will be applied.


Contextual selectors are more specific than a single element selector:  
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The embedded style sheet is closer to the element to be styled. 
So in the following situation the latter rule will be applied.

/* From external CSS file*/
 #content h1 {background-color: red;} 


/* In HTML file */
<style>
#content h1 {  
  background-color: yellow;
}
</style>
______________________________________________


A class selector beats any number of element selectors:
------------------------------------------------------- 

a class selector such as .intro beats h1, p, div, etc:


.intro {background-color: yellow;}

h1 {background-color: red;}
_________________________________________________



The universal selector and inherited values have a specificity of 0:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

*, body * and similar have a zero specificity. 
Inherited values also have a specificity of 0.
