<!-- What is Specificity ?
==========================

If there are two or more conflicting CSS rules that point to the same 
element, the browser follows some rules to determine which one is most 
specific and therefore wins out.

Think of 'specificity' as a score/rank that determines which style 
declarations are ultimately applied to an element.

The 'universal selector (*)' has low specificity, while 'ID selectors' are 
highly specific ! 


Note: 'Specificity' is a common reason why your CSS-rules don't apply 
====== to some elements, although you think they should.


Specificity Hierarchy
======================

Every selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy. 
There are four categories which define the specificity level of a selector:

> Inline styles : 
-----------------
An inline style is attached directly to the element to be styled. 
Example: <h1 style="color: #ffffff;">.

> IDs : 
-------
An ID is a unique identifier for the page elements, such as '#navbar'.

> Classes, attributes and pseudo-classes:
-----------------------------------------
This category includes .classes, [attributes] and pseudo-classes 
such as :hover, :focus etc.

> Elements and pseudo-elements:
--------------------------------
This category includes element names and pseudo-elements, such as h1, div, 
:before and :after.


How to Calculate Specificity ?
==============================

Memorize how to calculate specificity!

Start at 0,
add 1000 for style attribute, 
add 100 for each ID, 
add 10 for each attribute, class or pseudo-class, 
add 1 for each element name or pseudo-element.

Consider these three code fragments: -->

  </body>
</html>
